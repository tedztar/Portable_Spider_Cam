# Portable_Spider_Cam
I am working on making a portable spider cam that can be scalable. Because of this I will be using HC-12 wierless serial modules for the communication between the main processor and the motors 

Parts list: (this is what I am using but can be extreamly modified If you do modify please uplode your code for others)
1x raspberry pi (this is the main brain) (an use anycomputer with a sutibe adapter)
4x audrino (have not decide on what verstion)
4x steper motors
4x H brige for driving stepper motors
5x HC-12 wierless serial

power delivery for all moduals (can be mains powered but will desing some batery monorting in.)


Would like to have:
Indicator lights for connection and low battery
External remote (even if just a bunch of buttons)
Automatic callabration (This would be done with limit switches)
Computer controled ploting (i.e. tell the computer to do a circle aroung the point (X,Y) at hight (z) with a radious (r))
Manual controll (for ajusting wire tention)
