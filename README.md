# Portable_Spider_Cam
I am working on making a portable spider cam that can be scalable. Because of this I will be using LoRa modules for the communication between the main processor and the motors 

Would like to have:
Indicator lights for connection and low battery
External remote (even if just a bunch of buttons)
